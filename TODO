# To Implement

- Add support for Quarter tiling
    - Add support for mouse dragging
- Add support for a clipboard manager?
- Keybindings should be added to the settings keyboard shortcuts under a TOS heading

- When changing focus show a box in the center of each window to denote what keybind to press


- Support for gnome 43.alpha (Keep backwards compatibility)


> PS: Keep in mind that all these changes should play nice with a touch device (For future phone support)
